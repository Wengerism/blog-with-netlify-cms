Ok, so without format: "LLL" set in my datetime object in my config.yml, it reverts to shwoing all the timezone crap.  So i'm thinking all i can do is manually parse the returned date somehow, which seems to defeat the purpose of a functional cms to me - why can't it just display the friggin date only??
