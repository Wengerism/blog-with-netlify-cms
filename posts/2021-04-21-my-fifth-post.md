So yml config changed yet again, this time to incorporate the datetime widget, as the date widget is being depricated.. although it doesn't look like any new releases are coming out for netlify-cms so is it really worth worrying re deprication?  I digress, let's see if this workaound works for entering a date only field (without time) as suggested in the bug notes i found..
