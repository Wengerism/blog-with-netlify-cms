Ok so I've revised again and simplified my field input - the field object containing the datetime widget to be precise.  And I've made the image an optional inclusion with the required set to false.  And suddenly all is well, it's a decent CMS and it would appear that I'm simply a sleep deprived father of a one year old child who should think before deciding the CMS is crap, when in fact it's just me that didn't really understand the functionality.  Shock horror (insert laughing emoji here..)



Although the issue of not displaying the time details on the post (just the date) remains.. :-(
